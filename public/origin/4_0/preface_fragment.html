<p>Ruby is a delightful computer language explicitly designed to make
programmers happy. This philosophy influenced David Heinemeier Hansson
to pick Ruby when implementing the Rails web framework. Ruby on Rails,
as it's often called, makes building custom web applications faster
and easier than ever before. In the past few years, the Ruby on Rails
Tutorial has become the leading introduction to web development with
Rails.</p>

<p>In our interconnected world, computer programming and web application
development are rapidly rising in importance, and I am excited to
support Ruby on Rails for native Russian speakers. Although it is
important to learn English, which is the international language of
programming, it's often helpful at first to learn in your native
language. It is for this reason that I am grateful to Alexey Razuvaev
for producing the Russsian-language edition of the Ruby on Rails
Tutorial book.</p>

<p>I've never been to Russia, but I definitely plan to visit some day. I
hope I'll have the chance to meet some of you when I do!</p>

<p> Best wishes and good luck,</p>
